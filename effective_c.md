L-value: "l-value" refers to memory location which identifies an object. l-value may appear as either left hand or right hand side of an assignment operator(=). l-value often represets as identifier.

R-value: "r-value" refers to date value that is stored at some address in memory. A r-value is an expression that can't have a value assigned to it which means r-value can appear on right but not on left hand side of an assignment operator(=).
